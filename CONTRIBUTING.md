# How to contribute

# Making Changes
* Create a feature branch from where you want to base your work.
    * This is usually the development branch.
    * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
    * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.

# Review
When contributing to this project, your merge request is subject to review by merge request maintainers for this particular project.

When you submit code to GitLab, we really want it to get merged, but there will be times when it will not be merged.

When maintainers are reading through your merge request they may request guidance from other maintainers. If merge request maintainers conclude that the code should not be merged, the reasons will be fully disclosed. If it has been decided that the code quality is not up to Department for Work and Pensions standards, the merge request maintainer will refer the author to our docs and code style guides, and provide some guidance.
